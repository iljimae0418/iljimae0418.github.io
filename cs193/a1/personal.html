<p> Hi! My name is Luke and I am an undergraduate at <span style = "color:red; font-weight:bold">Stanford</span> majoring in Computer Science and minoring in Mathematics. I am also a member of the <span style = "color:red; font-weight:bold">Stanford</span> ACM and I have joined the ACM-ICPC Regional programming contest as a member of team <span style = "color:red; font-weight:bold">Stanford</span> White in 2016 (where we placed 8<sup>th</sup> out of 100+ teams). I am ethnically South Korean, but I spent most of my childhood in Hong Kong so I am able to speak Korean, Chinese and English. In terms of programming experience, I am proficient in C,C++,Python and I have experience working with Java, Javascript, HTML, CSS, R, Bash and android studios. </p>

<p> I am interested in the design and analysis of algorithms, trading, data science, machine learning, information theory and hacking. I have experiences working as a freelancer algorithmic trading programmer where I wrote C++ programs to do portfolio optimisations and wrote some python scripts to efficiently web crawl financial data for my employers. I also used to work at <a href = "http://yjmgames.com/?lang=en"> YJM games </a> in the mobile game division. Once I graduate, I am planning to acquire a masters in statistics and after that I am interested in being a programmer/data scientist working for companies solving important problems in this world or an algorithmic trader at a hedge fund. At the same time I would like to constantly study areas of machine learning and computer science and eventually contribute to the field by coming up with clever algorithms or discoveries. Feel free to contact me <a href = "mailto:mkim14@stanford.edu"> here </a> </p>

<p> I have many hobbies that I enjoy doing in my free time. </p>
