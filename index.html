<h1>Hi, my name is Luke</h1> 
  <h2> Brief Introduction about myself </h2> 
  <p> I am an undergraduate student studying Computer Science and Mathematics at Stanford University. I am currently on a leave from school and I am planning to go back 2018 January.</p>
  <p> I graduated from an international school in HK. In my free time, I like to read Math books or learn competitive programming techniques and computer algorithms. </p> 
  <p> Nowadays, I am also interested in android application development, Processing.js, machine learning and algorithm trading. My favourite programming languages are C++ and Python. </p>
