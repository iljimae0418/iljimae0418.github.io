	<center><h1> Modified Nim Game </h1> </center>
	<p> Let's play the "Modified Nim Game". This game is played by two people, namely me and you. </p>
	<p> There are <b> N </b> stones on the table. We take turns and remove the stone from the table. Only 1,3 or 4 stones can be removed at each turn. </p> 
	<p> The person who takes the last stone is the winner! </p> 
	<p> Suppose I (the computer) go first. If I give you the value of <b> N </b> can you guess who's going to win? </p> 
	<p> The value of N is: </p> 
	<p id = "N"></p>  
	<!-- <p id = "res"></p> --> 
	<p> Can you guess who's going to win? If you think I'll win, press the Computer button.If you think you'll win, press the Human button (Of course, under the assumption that both you and I are trying our best to win). </p>
