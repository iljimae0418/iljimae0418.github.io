  The algorithm calculates the exponential moving average (EMA) of the apple stock for a 17 day window, and also calculates the exponential
  moving average of teh apple stock for a 40 day window. If the 17 day window EMA is greater than 40 day EMA we place order of 40% of
  our funds and if the 40 day window EMA is greater, we sell.
