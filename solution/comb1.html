		There are \(16!\) total ways of wearing socks and shoes in random order. For any fixed leg, the probability that the spider will first put on the sock and then the shoe is \(\frac{1}{2}\), so the probability that the spider will correctly put on socks and shoes for all of its leg is \(\frac{1}{2^8}\). Thus, the number of correct permutations is 
		$$ \frac{16!}{2^8} $$
