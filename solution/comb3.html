		We start from (0,0) and after 10 steps, we will reach some (x,y), where 
		$$ |x| + |y| \leq 10 $$
		Furthermore, with each step, the parity of either the x or the y coordinate will change. 
		This means that after 10 steps, we can only be in (x,y) such that \(x+y\) is even. 
		Since \(x\) can be any integer from -10 to 10, and for each choice of \(x\), we have 
		$$ 11-|x| $$ possibilities for the value of y.  This means that there are totally
		$$ 2 \times (1+2+...+10) + 11 = \boxed{121} $$ possibilites.
