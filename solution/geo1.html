	Note from <a href = "http://artofproblemsolving.com/wiki/index.php?title=Ptolemy%27s_Theorem"> Ptolemy's Theorem </a> that 
	$$ 100 + 6FC = AC^2,  36+10FC = CE^2 $$ and  
	$$ CE^2 = AC^2 $$ 
	Note that the third relation is apparent from cosine law on \(\triangle ABC, \triangle CDE\). 
	<p> Solving for \(FC\) yields \(FC = 16\) </p> 
	<p> The area of the trapezium ABCF and DCFE are \(55\sqrt{3}\) and \(39\sqrt{3}\) respectively, so 
		adding them up yields \(94\sqrt{3}\), and \(m = 94\).  </p>
