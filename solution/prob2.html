	First observation: There are \(3 \times 4 \times 5 = 60\) such points in S. The number of ways 
	we can choose 2 points from these 60 points is $$ \frac{60*59}{2} = 1770 $$ 
	Now let's do some casework. Note that our goal is to make the x,y,z coordinates of the midpoint of 
	the two chosen points to be integer values. Suppose the two points we chose are \(p_1,p2\).  
	<ul> 
		<li> All x,y,z coordinates of \(p_1,p_2\) are even. There are \(2 \times 2 \times 3 = 12\) such points in S, and there are \(\frac{12 \times 11}{2} = 66\) ways to choose such points.</li>
		<li> All x,y,z coordinates of \(p_1,p_2\) are odd. There are \(1 \times 2 \times 2 = 4\) such points in S, and there are \(\frac{4 \times 3}{2} = 6\) ways to choose such points.</li>
		<li> Only x coordinates of \(p_1,p_2\) are odd. Using a similar logic as above,there are 6 such points and 15 ways to 2 out of these </li> 
		<li> Only y coordinates of \(p_1,p_2\) are odd. There are 12 such points and 66 ways to choose 2 out of these </li> 
		<li> Only z coordinates of \(p_1,p_2\) are odd. There are 8 such points and 28 ways to choose 2 out of these </li> 
		<li> Only x coordinates of \(p_1,p_2\) are even. There are 8 such points and 28 ways to choose 2 out of these </li> 
		<li> Only y coordinates of \(p_1,p_2\) are even. There are 4 such points and 6 ways to choose 2 out of these </li> 
		<li> Only z coordinates of \(p_1,p_2\) are even. There are 6 such points and 15 ways to choose 2 out of these </li> 
	</ul>
	Summing up we have 230 possible ways of choosing so our probability is \(\frac{23}{177}\).
