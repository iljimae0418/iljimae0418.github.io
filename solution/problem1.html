		Notice that 1 = 1, 10 = 1+2+3+4, 15 = 1+2+3+4+5, 28 = 1+2+3+4+5+6+7, 55 = 1+2+...+10, 66 = 1+2+...+11.  As such, the remaining 7 numbers are likely to be 
		<ul> 
			<li> 3 = 1+2 </li>
			<li> 6 = 1+2+3 </li> 
			<li> 21 = 1+2+3+4+5+6 </li> 
			<li> 36 = 1+2+...+8 </li> 
			<li> 45 = 1+2+...+9 </li> 
			<li> 78 = 1+2+...+12 </li> 
			<li> 91 = 1+2+...+13 </li> 
		</ul> 
		And the 7 police each went to house 3,6,21,35,45,78,91, but unfortunately, this was Phoebe's trick and she could easily steal from a house that is not in \(\{3,6,21,35,45,78,91\}\). Happy Town policemen were too naive!! :(
