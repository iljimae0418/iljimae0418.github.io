<h2> <center> Below are my analysis of the problems that are used to practice linux shell script from overthewires bandit challenge</center> </h2> 
<p> <center> <b> <font size = "5"> *** Level 0 *** </font> </b> </center> </p> 
The task at hand is simple. We have to log into the game using the ssh command. 
The host to which we need to connect is bandit.labs.overthewire.org on port 2220. The following command does the job: </br> <code> <font size = "4.7"> <center> ssh bandit0@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220 </center> </font> </code> 
<p> It will then ask you for the password, and you simply have to enter "bandit0" as instructed. As a reference, you should have a login page that looks like the following (generated from my terminal): </p> 
<center> <img src="sample level0.jpg" alt="login page" width = "500" height = "500"> </center>
<!-- End of level 0 tutorial --> 
<p> <center> <b> <font size = "5"> *** Level 0 -> Level 1 *** </font> </b> </center> </p> 
<p> While being logged in as bandit0, view the contents of the readme file using the command <code> <font size = "4.7"> <center> cat readme </center> </font> </code> </p> gives us the password "boJ9jbbUNNfktd78OOpsqOltutMc3MY1". i.e. the contents of the file readme. </p>
<p> <center> <b> <font size = "5"> *** Level 1 -> Level 2 *** </font> </b> </center></p>  
<p> After sshing as bandit1 after entering the password obtained in Level0 -> Level1, we need to obtain the contents of the file "-". This is a special character so we need to append "./" when calling this folder. The following code gives us the file content 
<code> <font size = "4.7"> <center> cat ./- </center> </font> </code> </p>. We then get the password "CV1DtqXWVFXTvM2F0k09SHz0YwRINYA9". We can then proceed to the next level and successfully login as bandit2. By the way, make sure you logout by the "logout" command before logging into bandit2. </p> 

<p><center><b><font size = "5"> *** Level 2 -> Level 3 *** </font></b></center></p>
<p> This time we are logged in as bandit2 (using the password from the previous section). There is a file called "spaces in this filename". To retrieve the contents of this file the following command should do the job: <code> <font size = "4.7"> <center> cat "spaces in this filename" </center></font></code></p>. <p> We then obtain the password "UmHadQclWmgdLOKQ3YNgjWxGoRMb5luK". </p>   

<p><center><b><font size = "5"> *** Level 3 -> Level 4 *** </font></b></center></p> 
<p> This time we are logged in as bandit3. We have to change directory to the directory "inhere". We use the following command: <code> <font size = "4.7"> <center> cd inhere </center> </font> </code> </p>. 
<p> We then realise that there are 
no files in the directory. But this is a trick, as there are hidden files. To look at hidden files, a command we can use is : 
  <code> <font = "4.7"> <center> ls -a </center> </font> </code> </p>. 
<p> We note that there is a file named ".hidden". The password can finally be obtained with the code <code> <font = "4.7"> <center> cat .hidden </code> </font></center>. The password turns out to be pIwrPrtPN36QITSp3EQaw936yaFoFgAB. </p>
