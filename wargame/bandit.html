<h2> <center> Below are my analysis of the problems that are used to practice linux shell script from overthewires bandit challenge</center> </h2> 
<p> <center> <b> <font size = "5"> *** Level 0 *** </font> </b> </center> </p> 
The task at hand is simple. We have to log into the game using the ssh command. 
The host to which we need to connect is bandit.labs.overthewire.org on port 2220. The following command does the job: </br> <code> <font size = "4.7"> <center> ssh bandit0@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220 </center> </font> </code> 
<p> It will then ask you for the password, and you simply have to enter "bandit0" as instructed. As a reference, you should have a login page that looks like the following (generated from my terminal): </p> 
<center> <img src="sample level0.jpg" alt="login page" width = "500" height = "500"> </center>
<!-- End of level 0 tutorial --> 
<p> <center> <b> <font size = "5"> *** Level 0 -> Level 1 *** </font> </b> </center> </p> 
<p> While being logged in as bandit0, view the contents of the readme file using the command <code> <font size = "4.7"> <center> cat readme </center> </font> </code> </p> gives us the password "boJ9jbbUNNfktd78OOpsqOltutMc3MY1". i.e. the contents of the file readme. </p>
<p> <center> <b> <font size = "5"> *** Level 1 -> Level 2 *** </font> </b> </center></p>  
<p> After sshing as bandit1 after entering the password obtained in Level0 -> Level1, we need to obtain the contents of the file "-". This is a special character so we need to append "./" when calling this folder. The following code gives us the file content 
<code> <font size = "4.7"> <center> cat ./- </center> </font> </code> </p>. We then get the password "CV1DtqXWVFXTvM2F0k09SHz0YwRINYA9". We can then proceed to the next level and successfully login as bandit2. By the way, make sure you logout by the "logout" command before logging into bandit2. </p> 

<p><center><b><font size = "5"> *** Level 2 -> Level 3 *** </font></b></center></p>
<p> This time we are logged in as bandit2 (using the password from the previous section). There is a file called "spaces in this filename". To retrieve the contents of this file the following command should do the job: <code> <font size = "4.7"> <center> cat "spaces in this filename" </center></font></code></p>. <p> We then obtain the password "UmHadQclWmgdLOKQ3YNgjWxGoRMb5luK". </p>   

<p><center><b><font size = "5"> *** Level 3 -> Level 4 *** </font></b></center></p> 
<p> This time we are logged in as bandit3. We have to change directory to the directory "inhere". We use the following command: <code> <font size = "4.7"> <center> cd inhere </center> </font> </code> </p>. 
<p> We then realise that there are 
no files in the directory. But this is a trick, as there are hidden files. To look at hidden files, a command we can use is : 
  <code> <font size = "4.7"> <center> ls -a </center> </font> </code> </p>. 
<p> We note that there is a file named ".hidden". The password can finally be obtained with the code <code> <font size = "4.7"> <center> cat .hidden </code> </font></center>. The password turns out to be "pIwrPrtPN36QITSp3EQaw936yaFoFgAB". </p>


<p><center><b><font size = "5"> *** Level 4 -> Level 5 *** </font></b></center></p> 
<p> After logging in as bandit4, we change the directory to "inhere" and realise that there are 10 files (from -file00 to -file09). </p> 
<p> Look at the contents of each file, and we see that -file07 contains the password we desire, "koReBOKuIDDepwhWk7jZC0RTdopnAYKh". </p> 

<p><center><b><font size = "5"> *** Level 5 -> Level 6 *** </font></b></center></p> 
<p> After logging in as bandit5, we change the directory to "inhere". We could open up all the sub directories and check all the files 
  in each sub directories, but there are too many of them and this is just tedious. </p>
<p> We could use the linux "find" command to make the job easier. Note that we are looking for a file that is human-readable, not executable and has size 1033 bytes. 
  The following command does the job: 
  <code> <font size = "4.7"> <center> find . -readable ! -executable -size 1033c </center> </font></code> </p>. 
<p> To explain the code a little, "find ." means to start searching from this directory. -readable, ! -executable, -size 1033c are flags that matches our 
  search requirements. We then get the result ./maybehere07/.file2 . Using <code> <font size = "4.7"> <center> cat ./maybehere07/.file2 </center></font></code> gives us the password 
  "DXjZPULLxYr17uwoI01bNLQbtFemEgo7". </p> 


<p><center><b><font size = "5"> *** Level 6 -> Level 7 *** </font></b></center></p> 
<p> This is similar to the previous level, but the difference is that we need to find the password somewhere on the <b>server</b> 
  as opposed to some directory. This forces us to use the command "find /" which means that we search starting from the root directory. </p> 
<p> The flags we set for the find the command are the following:  
  <code> <font size = "4.7"> <center> find / -group bandit6 -user bandit7 -size 33c 2>/dev/null </center></font></code> </p> 
<p> We have the final command "2>/dev/null" at the end because if we execute the command without 2>/dev/null then we get a lot of 
  permission denied errors on the server and we have to look through each of the results to see that the valid result is stored in 
  /var/lib/dpkg/info/bandit7.password. In order to avoid doing this tedious work of checking each standard output, we throw away the 
  stderr so that we can ignore them. So we see that the password is stored in <b> /var/lib/dpkg/info/bandit7.password </b> and the command 
  <code> <font size = "4.7"> <center> cat /var/lib/dpkg/info/bandit7.password </center> </font size> </code> </p> 
<p> Gives us the desired password "HKBPTKQnIay4Fw76bEy8PVxKEDQRKTzs". </p>
