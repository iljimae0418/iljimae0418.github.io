The task at hand is simple. We have to log into the game using the ssh command. 
The host to which we need to connect is bandit.labs.overthewire.org on port 2220. The following command does the job: </br> <code> <font size = "4.7"> <center> ssh bandit0@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220 </center> </font> </code> 
<p> It will then ask you for the password, and you simply have to enter "bandit0" as instructed. As a reference, you should have a login page that looks like the following (generated from my terminal): </p> 
<center> <img src="sample level0.jpg" alt="login page" width = "500" height = "500"> </center>
<!-- End of level 0 tutorial --> 
<p> <center> <b> <font size = "5"> *** Level 0 -> Level 1 *** </font> </b> </center> </p> 
<p> While being logged in as bandit0, view the contents of the readme file using the command <code> <font size = "4.7"> <center> cat readme </center> </font> </code> </p> gives us the password "boJ9jbbUNNfktd78OOpsqOltutMc3MY1". i.e. the contents of the file readme.
