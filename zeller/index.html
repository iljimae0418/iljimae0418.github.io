	<header> <h1> Zeller's Equation </h1> </header> 
	<p> Given the day,month and year I will calculate the day. e.g. given 01/01/1999, I will tell you that the day is Friday. The calculation is based on <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zeller%27s_congruence"> Zeller's Equation. </a> The program is not very robust. Will add robustness features later. And of course we are talking about the gregorian calender. </p>
